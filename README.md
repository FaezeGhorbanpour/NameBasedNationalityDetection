## Emigration vs Return Migration
### How does the migration pattern of scholars change if we consider the nationality of their names?

Welcome to the official code repository for the paper **"Differentiating Emigration from Return Migration of Scholars Using Name-Based Nationality Detection Models."**

This repository contains the implementation of the methods described in our paper, which focuses on character-level deep learning techniques to detect a person's nationality based solely on their full name. These methods helped us distinguish between emigration and return migration among scholars.


### Coming Soon!
Stay tuned for the release of the code and further documentation.
